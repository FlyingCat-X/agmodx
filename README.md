## ‚òâ Description

AG Mod X is an improved Mini AG alternative made as a plugin for AMX Mod X from the ground. It's easy to add new stuff, make improvements, do changes, etc.

### ‚ò∞ Features
- Uses Bugfixed HL in the core, a HL that fixes a lot of issues and comes with some features and improvements (Check the wiki).
- Some fixes and improvements to the original Mini AG.
- Supports multilingual (English and Spanish already included).
- Portability, because of the nature of the mod, it allows to use other plugins in your server, and in case it's interfering with other plugins, you can switch it off.

### ‚ò∞ Improvements
- CTF game mode has been ported (partially).
- Color codes are now displayed and they don't get removed anymore.
- Weapons are displayed in spectator mode.
- No more standing corpses bug from clients playing with high FPS.
- Now antiflood doesn't get block anymore when game is paused.
- HUD and votes are now displayed in the AG Style.
- Now you can type player's name in cmds like `agallow`, `agkick` or `agforcespectator` partially and without adding color codes.
- New votes have been added and some `sv_ag_dmg_xxx` cvars have been fixed (Check the wiki).
